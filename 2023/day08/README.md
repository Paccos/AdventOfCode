# Day 8 - Haunted Wasteland

Language: `Swift`

To run, either open project in Xcode and run from there, OR simply type `cd day08 && swiftc *.swift && ./main`

**Caveat:** If you run from within Xcode, you have to adjust the filepath to the input file in `let input = try String(contentsOfFile: "input")` in `main.swift`.
